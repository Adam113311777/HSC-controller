A project where I created a wireless controller using ESP32.<br>
The main idea is to have a conttoller that can be fully customized both in the terms of software and hardware. For example if your robot uses custom communication inteface, there is no need to design a custom controller, it takes a lot of time. Instead you could use something like this where you already have a functioning platform with rich features and components in whch you just use your custom code and that's it. It's fster and less resource intensive.<br>
The controller features OLED display, four vibration motors, IMU unit BNO086, joysticks, buttons.<br>
It's powered from two 21700 batteries with about 30Wh combined.<br>
